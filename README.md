# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python-based terminal game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 📌 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- You enter your guess through the terminal.
- The program gives feedback:
  - If your guess is **too low**, it asks you to guess higher.
  - If your guess is **too high**, it asks you to guess lower.
  - If your guess is **correct**, it congratulates you and ends the game.
